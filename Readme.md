## How HuracÃ¡n works

Huracan is a privacy DeFi application that uses a technique named _private inclusion proofs_ to create what we call a _mixer_. This system is capable of proving that a user deposited ether to a contract wihout revealing which one he is.

_Each user that deposits ether to the contract is placed in a public merkle tree on the contract state_

In order to make this possible, we need a smart contract where the funds will be deposited y when doing so a merkle tree will be generated where every leaf represents a depositant. Additionally, we will need a circuit that will generate merkle inlusion proofs that will keep the user anonymous when withdrawing the funds. And finally, we'll also run a relayer that will execute the transaction in behalf or the user so he can preserver his privacy.

_Users can withdraw funds without revealing their identities_
